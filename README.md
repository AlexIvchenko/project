[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NetCracker-2017-Team/project.svg?branch=master)]()

This platform is designed as a game to help you to form good habits and to get rid of the bad.

# Building
Make sure that [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) are installed

Build it as follow
```bash
mvn clean install 
```
By default integration tests won't run but you can explicitly define that you want to run only unit tests
```bash
mvn clean install -P unit
```
To enable only integration tests you have to define database connection environment variables:
```
JDBC_DATABASE_URL={for example: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdb}
JDBC_DATABASE_USERNAME={your username here}
JDBC_DATABASE_PASSWORD={your password here}
```
And run it as follow
```bash
mvn clean install -P integration
```
To run all tests during building: (in this case you also have to define environment variables as in previous section)
```bash
mvn clean install -P full
```
# Running
Once application is built

Run it as follow if you want to use embedded database
```bash
java -jar service/target/service.jar
```
If you want to use postgres database, you should define the following environment variables and run it as in previous section
```
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
JDBC_DATABASE_URL={for example: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdb}
JDBC_DATABASE_USERNAME={your username here}
JDBC_DATABASE_PASSWORD={your password here}
```
